- LambdaCase
- NoStarIsType

## deriving-related

- DeriveAnyClass

# features that should be default
- GADTs
- RoleAnnotations

# other features
- DefaultSignatures
- TypeFamilies
- DataKinds

# other syntax
- MagicHash

# useful extensions to know about, but which should be specified on-demand
#
# UndecidableInstances:
#   required for type class wizardry
#   generally only enable if you were expecting to & compilation fails without
# AllowAmbiguousTypes:
#   often goes hand in hand with TypeApplications-heavy code
#   enabling on demand brings attention to the sort of functions to expect
# StarIsType:
#   may need to enable if you're working with old code that uses `Int :: *`

ghc-options:
- -Wall

# omitting ticks is fine (prevents warnings for <= GHC 9.2)
# see: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20531
